# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Cloudflare Pages Deployment

This project is configured for deployment to Cloudflare Pages using Wrangler.

### Prerequisites

1. A Cloudflare account
2. Wrangler CLI installed (already included as dev dependency)

### Deployment Commands

- **Local development with Wrangler**: `npm run pages:dev`
- **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages**: `npm run pages:deploy`

### First Time Setup

1. Login to Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```

2. Deploy your site:
   ```bash
   npm run pages:deploy
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to create a new project or deploy to an existing one.

### Configuration

The `wrangler.toml` file contains the configuration for Cloudflare Pages deployment. The build output directory is set to `dist` which is generated by Vite during the build process.

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
